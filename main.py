class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    """
    A class representing an evolutionary algorithm.

    Attributes:
    - population_size (int): The size of the population.
    - mutation_rate (float): The rate of mutation.
    - crossover_rate (float): The rate of crossover.

    Methods:
    - initialize_population(): Initializes the population with random individuals.
    - evaluate_fitness(): Evaluates the fitness of each individual in the population.
    - selection(): Performs selection to choose parents for reproduction.
    - crossover(): Performs crossover to create offspring.
    - mutation(): Performs mutation on the offspring.
    - replace_population(): Replaces the current population with the offspring.
    - run(): Runs the evolutionary algorithm.
